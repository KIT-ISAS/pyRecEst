# Public API Registry

The public API registry is the set of names exported by package-level namespaces
such as `pyrecest.filters`. It complements the backend API matrix: the registry
answers "what name is public?" and the matrix answers "which backend supports
that name?"

The machine-readable source is `src/pyrecest/api_registry.py`.

Run this check after adding, removing, stabilizing, deprecating, or reclassifying
user-facing APIs:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/check_public_api_registry.py --check docs/public-api-registry.md
```

## Rules

1. Prefer one canonical spelling for each public object.
2. Keep compatibility aliases only when they protect existing user code or a
   documented external naming convention.
3. Add every new backend-sensitive object to `docs/backend-api-matrix.md` and
   `src/pyrecest/_backend/capabilities.py`.
4. Keep lazy export maps, `__all__`, and documentation synchronized with tests.

## Filters Namespace

`pyrecest.filters` is lazy: importing the namespace does not import every
tracker implementation. Add new filter symbols to `_FILTER_EXPORTS` in
`src/pyrecest/filters/__init__.py`; `__all__` is generated from that map.

Compatibility aliases such as mixed acronym/camelcase tracker names should stay
mapped to the same implementation module as their canonical form. New examples
and documentation should use the canonical spelling.

| API | Module | Category | Backend contract | Notes |
|-----|--------|----------|------------------|-------|
| `BackendFacade` | `pyrecest.backend` | backend-specific | `BackendFacade` | Facade names are importable across backends, with bridged or unsupported functions documented in the backend matrix. |
| `DistributionConversion` | `pyrecest.distributions.conversion` | backend-specific | `DistributionConversion` | Euclidean Gaussian/particle routes are portable; grid, Fourier, and manifold routes are route-specific. |
| `EuclideanParticleFilter` | `pyrecest.filters` | backend-specific | `EuclideanParticleFilter` | Particle behavior depends on sampler and resampling support in the active backend. |
| `EvaluationUtilities` | `pyrecest.evaluation` | backend-specific | `EvaluationUtilities` | Plotting, assignment, summaries, and result helpers are only partly backend-portable. |
| `GaussianDistribution` | `pyrecest.distributions` | stable | `GaussianDistribution` | Basic construction, moment access, and portable operations are part of the core distribution API. |
| `KalmanFilter` | `pyrecest.filters` | stable | `KalmanFilter` | Linear Gaussian filtering is part of the portable baseline. |
| `LinearDiracDistribution` | `pyrecest.distributions` | stable | `LinearDiracDistribution` | Core particle-style representation used by conversion and filtering workflows. |
| `MultiBernoulliTracker` | `pyrecest.filters` | backend-specific | `MultiBernoulliTracker` | Tracking workflows rely on assignment and measurement-set utilities with NumPy-oriented paths. |
| `PointSetRegistration` | `pyrecest.utils` | backend-specific | `PointSetRegistration` | Registration helpers may bridge through NumPy/SciPy and are not guaranteed differentiable. |
| `SphericalHarmonicsEOTTracker` | `pyrecest.filters` | backend-specific | `SphericalHarmonicsEOTTracker` | Depends on spherical-harmonics and SciPy-adjacent functionality. |
| `UKFOnManifolds` | `pyrecest.filters` | backend-specific | `UKFOnManifolds` | Current predict/update paths explicitly exclude JAX. |
| `UnscentedKalmanFilter` | `pyrecest.filters` | backend-specific | `UnscentedKalmanFilter` | Portable for backend-compatible model functions; advanced paths may bridge through NumPy/SciPy. |
