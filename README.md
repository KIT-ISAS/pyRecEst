# PyRecEst

Recursive Bayesian Estimation for Python.

PyRecEst is a Python library for recursive Bayesian estimation on Euclidean
spaces and manifolds. It uses a NumPy backend by default and can also run with
PyTorch or JAX backends.

## Features

PyRecEst provides tools for:

- distributions and densities on Euclidean spaces and manifolds;
- recursive Bayesian estimators, filters, and trackers;
- multi-target tracking (MTT) and extended object tracking (EOT);
- evaluation of filters and trackers; and
- sampling distributions and generating grids.

## Installation

PyRecEst requires Python 3.11 or newer and earlier than Python 3.15.

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install pyrecest
```

Optional backend and domain-specific dependencies can be installed with extras:

```bash
python -m pip install "pyrecest[pytorch_support]"
python -m pip install "pyrecest[jax_support]"
python -m pip install "pyrecest[healpy_support]"
```

For development from a source checkout, use Poetry or the provided conda
environment:

```bash
poetry install --with dev --all-extras
# or
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Quickstart

The following example runs a one-dimensional constant-velocity Kalman filter.
It uses the backend abstraction exposed by `pyrecest.backend`, so the same code
can run on supported numerical backends.

```python
from pyrecest.backend import array, diag
from pyrecest.filters import KalmanFilter


dt = 1.0
system_matrix = array([[1.0, dt], [0.0, 1.0]])
measurement_matrix = array([[1.0, 0.0]])
system_noise_cov = diag(array([0.05, 0.01]))
measurement_noise_cov = array([[0.25]])
measurements = [0.9, 2.0, 3.1, 3.9, 5.2]

kalman_filter = KalmanFilter((array([0.0, 1.0]), diag(array([1.0, 1.0]))))

for measurement in measurements:
    kalman_filter.predict_linear(system_matrix, system_noise_cov)
    kalman_filter.update_linear(
        array([measurement]), measurement_matrix, measurement_noise_cov
    )
    print(kalman_filter.get_point_estimate())
```

Run the complete script with:

```bash
python examples/basic/kalman_filter.py
```

## Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains the first project documentation pages:

- [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) covers installation, development
  setup, backend selection, and running examples.
- [API overview](docs/api-overview.md) maps the main packages and points to the
  most common public entry points.
- [Backend compatibility](docs/backend-compatibility.md) explains the NumPy,
  PyTorch, and JAX support model and known limitations.
- [API reference](docs/reference/index.md) contains generated package reference
  pages built with MkDocs and mkdocstrings.
- [Task tutorials](docs/tutorials/index.md) show common distribution, filtering,
  tracking, and evaluation workflows.
- [Shapes and conventions](docs/conventions.md) documents common vector,
  matrix, measurement-set, batch, and manifold-coordinate shapes.
- [Examples](examples/README.md) lists the executable examples and what each
  one demonstrates.

Build the documentation site locally with:

```bash
poetry install --with docs --without dev
poetry run mkdocs build --strict
```

## Backends

PyRecEst imports `pyrecest.backend` dynamically. The default backend is NumPy.
Set `PYRECEST_BACKEND` before Python imports `pyrecest` to select another
backend:

```bash
PYRECEST_BACKEND=pytorch python examples/basic/kalman_filter.py
PYRECEST_BACKEND=jax python examples/basic/kalman_filter.py
```

Install the matching optional extra before using a non-default backend.

## Examples and tests

- `examples/basic/kalman_filter.py` contains a small executable Kalman filter
  example.
- `tests/` contains additional usage examples for distributions, filters,
  smoothers, evaluation, sampling, metrics, and tracking utilities.

To run the test suite from a development environment:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
