"""Public protocol contracts for PyRecEst extension points.

The :mod:`pyrecest.protocols` package contains small, runtime-checkable
capability protocols for user-defined PyRecEst components. Protocols are public
contracts: they describe the methods, attributes, and conventions that later
modules can rely on without forcing users to inherit from a specific abstract
base class.
