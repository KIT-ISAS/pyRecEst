"""Common delayed-output interface for online fixed-lag smoothers.

Some online smoothers produce an estimate only after a finite look-ahead window
has become available.  They therefore need a small queue of ``(step, state)``
records and a finalization path that flushes the end-of-trajectory tail.  This
module keeps that API in one place without prescribing any particular smoothing
algorithm or state representation.
